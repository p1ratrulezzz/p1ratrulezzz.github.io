The chat bot for VKontakte network. It is not a community bot, this is just an emulation of human account so it is easy to add this bot in dialogs and resend their messages to other people.

### Tatar-russian dictionary (js driven)

This was developed very long time ago on Nokia N70 so this is why the design is so small for new devices.
